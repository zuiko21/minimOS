temp		= sel_gh
score		= sel_gh + 1	; score in BCD (a tenth of the original score, thus up to 99990 in the arcade)
goal		= score + 2		; desired goal for extra life, every 1000 points (MSB-only is $10 increments -- in BCD!) *new* 
lives		= goal + 1		; remaining lives
level		= lives + 1		; game level
; will need some timers for mode change
dots		= level + 1		; remaining dots

des_dir		= pre_pt + 2	; desired direction (formerly tmp_arr+4)
vh_mask		= des_dir + 1	; direction mask to allow/disable axis changes
cur_y		= vh_mask + 1	; current Y index for screen (formerly as cur)

; possible status changes
; WAIT->GROW->SCATTER->CHASE... (switching between SCATTER and CHASE)
; S/C->FRIGHT->FLASH->S/C (FR.-FL. alternate 5 or 3 times, alwasy ending in FLASH)
; FRIGHT/FLASH->EATEN->GROW (being eaten, immediate exit from base)
; WAIT->FR_WAIT->FR_GROW->FL_GROW (rare, especially the latter)
; FLG->FRG->S (probably no time to switch more than once) fl_wait makes little sense

; usual changes are 4<->6, 12<->14 and, rarely, 20<->22, that is xxx*x
; pill does 4/6->12, 01x0->11*0, and sometimes 0->16 or 2->18
; eaten goes 12/14->10, 11x0->1010, then 0010
; initial sequence is 0->2->4 or, rarely, 16...20->22->12/14
; xx000 are invisible, and 10010 as well
