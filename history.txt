minimOS version history
(c) 2012-2021 Carlos J. Santisteban

0.1a1 (2007-02-03):
	-ran (rather buggy!) on a 6502 emulator written in C.
	-cout and string only (!) 
	-supports 6845 VDU and 6551 ACIA
	-hardwired slots (VDU, RAM, NuBus...)
	-debugger stub

0.1.a2 (2007-03-13, incomplete):
	-revamped zeropage & I/O area
	-UART 16C550 instead of ACIA 6551
	-intended support for RTC MC146818 and Hitachi LCD
	-detects CPU type (NMOS, CMOS, Rockwell, C816)

0.2: complete rewrite for "less hardwired" slots; never assembled

0.3: design stage of a much more flexible architecture, hardly any coding

***THE REAL THING***

0.4a1 (2012-11-19):
	-Preliminary API, 11 kernel functions
	-EXTREMELY KLUDGY memory management...

0.4a2 (2012-12-05):
	-modular coding (#includes et al)
	-added 3 kernel functions (su_peek, su_poke, string)
	-supports LED keypad; intended support for LCD and ACIA

0.4a3 (2012-12-26)
	-NEW KERNEL CALL ADDRESS, doesn't need over 8 kiB
	-SEPARATE device drivers: LED keypad so far, dummy driver for others
	-drivers have 5 routines: reset, poll, request, input, output
		poll = called by periodical interrupt (VIA timer 1)
		request = called by device-generated IRQ (should check source)

0.4b1 (2012-12-26)
	-Assembled for SDd (untested so far)
0.4b2 (2013-02-19)
	-New API for disabling/enabling interrupts
	-New API for frequency generator, ø2/(2n)
	-drivers have now 9 routines -- add 1-sec interrupt, block I/O and shutdown procedure to those above (a3)
	-offset 18 @ driver header has authorization code about driver capabilities:
		D7 = poll (may need to be authorized by future kernel versions)
		D6 = request (id.)
		D5 = input capable
		D4 = output capable
		D3 = 1-sec. interrupt (may be authorized)
		D2 = block-input capable
		D1 = block-output capable
		D0 = relocatable / loadable on-the-fly (not yet implemented)
	-sorted out preprocessor issues... :-(
		*NO comments after #defines
		*macros with colons shouldn't be written inside comments (!)
	-not really necessary, but changed all constants to Hex, name beginning with underscore
	-Assembled for SDd with LED-keypad driver only, NMOS version available
	-Some (future) support for MTE, SDx and stub driver for SS-22 port!

0.4b3 (2013-05-04)
	-Essentially a debug release
	-ISR finally acknowledges VIA-T1 interrupt!!!
	-Minor fixes in LED Keypad driver
	-Some builds with debug code for hex display
	-Among other things, RAM check algorithm was faulty

0.4b4b (2013-05-05) ***** FIRST SUCCESSFUL BOOT!!! *****
	-Built for SDd CMOS
	-Debug driver for Hex display
	-New, faster RAM check algorithm

0.4b4LK4 (2013-05-12)
	-Based on 0.4b4b
	-Complete rewrite of LED Keypad driver, with single byte FIFO
	-Typing program at the end of POST, only to demonstrate
	-Dirty NMI "debugger"

0.4rc (2013-05-21)
	-Final release of 0.4 version
	-Fixed LED keypad driver: made spurious keystroke at powerup
	-Minor cosmetic changes
	-Separate "shell.s" file included after POST

====================================================

0.4.1 TO DO:
	-uptime() API in ticks + 24-bit seconds
	-Generic FIFO
	-Driver for ASCII keyboard + Hitachi LCD
	-Droplet-like startup sound!
	-User-installed NMI routine, with 'magic number' for safety
	-Tidy up exec() even without filesystem
	-Possible modification of SDd in order to use ACIA; finish appropriate driver
	-Driver for SS-22 port
	-Boot from SS-22 "server"!
	-Possible new naming convention
	-Fix remaining bug on LED keypad driver when more than three dots go...

	-0.4.x will become a single-task fork of 0.5 and beyond.
=================================================
0.5 to do:

All of the above plus:
	-software multitasking (4 jobs)
	-separate firmware and modules
	-possible "netbooting" via ACIA instead of SS-22 (separate, simplified FW drivers)
	-hardware options described in options.h for easier porting
	-improved memory management
